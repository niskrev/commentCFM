This is a slightly edited version of a file with the same name included in 
the replication files accompanying Canova, Ferroni and Matthes's article in
the Journal of Applied Econometrics. Running it will check for identification
of the parameters listed between lines 174 and 203 given a subset of variables
specified in line 206. This is not the code I used but the conclusion seems to
be the same although I didn't check all possible combinations.
