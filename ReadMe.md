This is a comment to the article “Choosing the variables to estimate singular DSGE models,” by F. Canova, F. Ferroni, and C. Matthes published in the [Journal of Applied Econometrics](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1099-1255), 29, 1099–1117.

The file in code is a slightly edited version of a file with the same name included in the replication files accompanying Canova et al. Running it will check for identification of the parameters listed between lines 174 and 203 given a subset of variables specified in line 206. This is not the code I used in writing the comment but the conclusion seems to be the same although I didn't check all possible combinations.
